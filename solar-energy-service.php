                <h4>What is Jaisriâ€™s Unrestricted Access Power Solution?</h4>
                <p>The Industrial and Commercial sectors consume a significant portion of the world's energy. The heavy reliance on fossil fuels not only harms the environment by increasing carbon emissions but also impacts the profitability of companies. For industries, utility bills alone can account for at least 10% of their revenue. Jaisri offers a solar power solution that enables high fossil energy consumers to transition to green energy, benefiting both their profits and the communities they serve.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the Electricity Act of 2003, high-power consumers, especially HT Commercial & Industrial consumers, have the option to fulfill their Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) by procuring power from Independent Power Producers (IPPs). These IPPs produce Renewable Energy (RE) from their Off-site Solar farms and supply it to consumers at a more affordable rate than State DISCOM (Distribution companies) tariffs. By purchasing green energy for their consumption, companies can not only reduce their power costs but also help in reducing CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel production. Jaisri offers appealing Unrestricted Access plans to meet the growing demand for green energy among its clients.</p>

            <div class="py-2">            
                <h4>How it works?</h4>
                <ul class="px-2">
                    <li>Jaisri generates solar power from its existing MW capacity Solar farms in Tamilnadu or develops new Solar farms.</li>
                    <li>Signs a long-term bilateral Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with HT consumers based on an attractive solar energy tariff, chosen from the available open access models.</li>
                    <li>The generated Solar power is delivered to consumers' HT locations through the state DISCOM grid.</li>
                    <li>Consumers pay only for the power consumed at their location.</li>
                    <li>Jaisri takes responsibility for end-to-end operation and maintenance of the solar power plant.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="py-2">
                <h4>Group Captive Plan</h4>
                <p>As the name implies, this plan allows one or more groups of HT consumers to collectively invest 26% of the equity in the Solar SPV project. Consumers sign a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Jaisri and collectively consume a minimum of 51% of the power generated from the Solar SPV, which will be developed and maintained by Jaisri. Jaisri retains ownership of the solar plant, and consumers pay only for the energy delivered to them as per the PPA through the State DISCOM grid.</p>
                <h6>Key features of Group Captive Plan</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>One or more business clients can participate as equity investors in the group.</li>
                    <li>Equity investment of 26% in the SPV project cost.</li>
                    <li>Combined minimum of 51% energy off-take by the clients from the energy generated by the SPV project.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="py-2">
                <h4>Third-Party Power Purchase</h4>
                <p>This Unrestricted Access plan provides an attractive model for HT consumers who want to enjoy a risk-free discounted tariff without any investment in the project. The client signs a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Jaisri on a discounted tariff for an agreed-upon duration and receives the contracted energy delivered to their HT locations. Clients pay only for the consumed units along with state DISCOM open access charges and other stipulated fees.</p>
                <h6>Key features of Third-Party Power Purchase Plan</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zero investment required from the client.</li>
                    <li>HT consumers sign a bilateral PPA with Jaisri to obtain the required power supply at a discounted tariff, as per the agreed-upon energy delivery quantum.</li>
                    <li>Guaranteed discounted tariff for the entire PPA tenure.</li>
                    <li>Clients are free from the worries of plant maintenance and periodic repairs, as Jaisri takes care of these responsibilities.</li>
